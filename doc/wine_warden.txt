Use wardend only under Win32 enviroment.

To fix somethink like:

err:module:import_dll Library MSVCR90.dll (which is needed by L"C:\warden\MSVCP90.dll") not found
err:module:import_dll Library MSVCP90.dll (which is needed by L"C:\warden\ACE.dll") not found
err:module:import_dll Library MSVCR90.dll (which is needed by L"C:\warden\ACE.dll") not found
err:module:import_dll Library ACE.dll (which is needed by L"C:\warden\wardend.exe") not found

winetricks --force -q vcrun2008

no use wineconsole.
use xvfb-its dummy X

Xvfb :1 &
export DISPLAY=:1
wine wardend.exe

Thanks SignFinder for help.
